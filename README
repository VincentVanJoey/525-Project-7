1. Copy the files to your own directory.

2. Modify inet.h to reflect the host you are currently logged into.
   Also, modify the port numbers to be used to reduce the likelihood
   of conflicting with another server.

3. Compile the source code using the command: make

4. Start the chat and directory servers in the background: ./directoryServer3 &; ./chatServer3 &

5. Start the client on the same or another host in the foreground: ./chatClient2

6. Remember to kill the server before logging off.

-- "Brief Narrative" of results - Joey Monaco --

OLD EXPLANATION FROM FOR TODO CHANGE:
Setup:
--> make clean, make, clear
--> Start directory server with ./directoryServer2 
--> Start an amount of servers with calls with the following parameters replaced ./chatServer2 ["topic"] [port]
   --> throw an & on the end to run it in the background of the terminal
   --> assuming no duplicate topics and availible ports, this will register the chat server and start it on the desired port
--> connect to the directory by initializing a chat client with ./chatClient2 and then entering a number from the list of servers given (if any)

From here, all implementation should line up with the chat server implementation from Assignment 3, with the extra layer of the directory server.
The Directory Server is queried upon a client's initial connection for a list of active Chat Server Topic/IP addresses/ports.
Clients can only select from the given servers listed, and must disconnect/reconnect to the directory for an updated list.

When a chat server exits(or crashes), the directory server will note it is De-registered, freeing the server's a topic
--> very similar to the nicknames of clients from the last one.

All implementation otherwise works as described in the assignment!
